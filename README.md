# Modular Python CLI Framework

A lightweight, extensible, and type-driven Python CLI framework inspired by Typer and Click.  
Designed to be a reusable core for building command-line applications with clean separation between framework and app logic.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Modular architecture separating core framework and CLI applications  
- Type-driven argument parsing using Python type hints  
- Simple command registration via `@command` decorator  
- Supports JSON input/output for automation and scripting  
- Configurable via environment variables and config files (JSON/YAML)  
- Extensible with planned support for REPL, plugins, and tab completion  
- Lightweight core with minimal dependencies

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1. Install the framework (local development)

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd cli_framework
pip install -e .
````

### 2. Create your CLI app

```bash
mkdir my_cli_app
cd my_cli_app
```

### 3. Define commands

`commands/greet.py`:

```python
from cli_framework.core.command import command

@command(name="greet")
def greet(name: str = "World", times: int = 1):
    for _ in range(times):
        print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

### 4. Create CLI entrypoint

`main.py`:

```python
from cli_framework.core.app import CLIApp
import my_cli_app.commands.greet  # Import commands to register

if __name__ == "__main__":
    CLIApp().run()
```

### 5. Run your CLI app

```bash
python main.py greet --name Alice --times 3
```

Output:

```
Hello, unknown!
```

## 📝 JSON Support

Commands can optionally accept JSON input and output JSON results to support automation workflows and scripting.

## 🔧 Future Work

* Interactive REPL mode
* Plugin system for extending commands
* Tab completion and command suggestions
* Enhanced config management and logging
