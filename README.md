# Modular Python CLI Framework

A lightweight, extensible, and type-driven Python CLI framework inspired by Typer and Click.  
Designed to be a reusable core for building command-line applications with clean separation between framework and app logic.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Modular architecture separating core framework and CLI applications  
- Type-driven argument parsing using Python type hints  
- Simple command registration via `@command` decorator  
- Supports JSON input/output for automation and scripting  
- Configurable via environment variables and config files (JSON/YAML)  
- Extensible with planned support for REPL, plugins, and tab completion  
- Lightweight core with minimal dependencies
